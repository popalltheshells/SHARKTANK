# SHARKTANK
This repo contains containerized hacking tools (in a form of Dockerfiles), so that it does not mess with your machine's dependencies. 

## To build
To build and use the tools, each Dockerfile will contain docker run command to use the tool.
``` docker build -t toolname . ```
``` docker run -it toolname <argument>```
